# BevyMenuExample
A larger version of the Bevy menu example - expanded modules out to separate files 
and removed some bits that weren't working - at least, on Windows and in Bevy 0.9 
which is the one I've tested with. I hope to make this more comprehensive in the 
future. 

### Project Outline
The framework here gives an example of moving between menu screens and setting some global 
variables based on the settings screen.
